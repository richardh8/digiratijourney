This book is dedicated to my Grandfather, Josef Hechenbichler (1913-1996), who's companion, teachings and proverbs have been essential to my formation as an ingenious and creative human being. And by making me more prepared to go through persistent inner wars with determination in order to overcome my own mind limitations using my own spiritual crafts.
 
Also wanted to dedicate this book to my wife Samyrah, my sons Josef, Patrick, Peter, and daughter Sophie for supporting me to go through this battle, and allowing me time to get inspired, create and write this book.

>“Only as a warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge. A warrior cannot complain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge, and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges.”
― Carlos Castaneda

## Prologue
The contents of this book have been widely conceived, elaborated and gained shape and form over the past 4 years. Back then, after spending a long career since 1993 working with digital (back then this terminology didn't exist), I came to the realization that the human factor and leadership traits in digital related projects and endeavors, were the most relevant factors of success, and the ones that expressed greatest results, thus my mind just clicked to it, rendering many insights which are written in this book. Nowadays, the human factor is not a new issue and matter, but years ago, that was not recognized as a foundational element for the digital age, which makes us reflect, gain new knowledge about humans and society as never before. In such a fast pace, the digital era of society, businesses and organizations across the globe, set the stage for inconvenient truths to an evolved mind in astonishing science discoveries and applications. So human factor has no true originality anymore, as it has been recognized at large by many in the industry, back lacking the thinking on new paradigms and interests to drive and lead the way, off course in general. So I can say that once you taste it by yourself through your own experience, it makes a whole different story, and takes you to a level that you can't go back, you become aware and conscious, the modern warriors way, blending personal experiences with social ones, in a single continuum of consciousness evolution. The issue around the digital transformation domain, relies truly on its complexity, variety, quality and maturity of the contents, practices, forums, methods, technical parafernalia and demands technical skills associated with it, however it can't be ignored the most common but neglected human traits, and what makes us human, as this is the factor acting the main pillar of sustantionality, as it supports the purpose, moral and ethics of all the journey we are all encompassing, as human beings, we build solutions to problems of our own and the planet, and we can't operate as robots with extreme rationality, like machines, with cold blood in a controlled experiment with limited possibilities of outcome. Of course, complexity is relative, for those who have mastered some knowledge, complexity is drastically decreased, or matters can be simplistic, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, the matter here in regards to the digital transformation domain, is on the fact that needs to be puzzled together holistically, and could not be looked or experienced from outside, it has to come from original experiences in hands on work, in order to bring true value to the digital transformation theme on interested communities that want to thrive on ongoing learning and deep dives in human positive experiences.

I had to be careful not to over simplify contents to not become superficial, but pass on knowledge to people in a democratized and accessible way, with a strong meaning to back it up their learnings, by establishing rapport through ludic styles, storytelling to retain attention and memorization, as well practical circumstances. All in the search to get us to the next levels of innovation and overcome known challenges in a common sense and normalized structure as a body of knowledge. But most importantly, with positive and optimistic purposes, more than ever we should pay attention and build profound empathy to ourselves and humans, and solve wicked problems which we developed tolerance for centuries. If digital comes as a new plain level ground, let's make that as the chance to build a fair, equal and why not, one lovely place for us to grow, build trust, live in harmony within possible reasons.

It all started on defining knowledge domains and how comprehensive, broad and relevant they are for the leaders and people engaged in digital developments. That rendered me with a Digital Transformation Canvas. However after my personal journey and evolution, and facing the challenges ahead of me, many other elements have been appended to this array of experiences, which I call the Digital Hive. You may read this book orderly as laid out, or pick the honeycomb cluster you wish within the eight domains and its general foundations.

I have blissfully and luckily been involved with digital technology projects since I started working at the age of eighteen years old, and it has been an awesome learning journey. I had the chance to experiment, implement and innovate with edgy technologies, practices and methods, and have always been growing professionally and personally, as I could not help if not accept the fact that I am a single conscientious phenoma. I also like to believe I was lucky because beyond working with edgy technologies, I was working on new departments and areas, and new terrain to be built and exploited. And finally, yes, the human beings, because they are the root of everything, without them, my perspectives would be just a small and limited bubble of interpretations, decisions and knowledge.

The book is structured in chapters, which have a rationale for it, within it, we have the episodes classified by each domain. Episodes are made of its "branded theme", short inspirational and contextualizable quote, an image from a movie, a caption of that movie, rationale and linkage of of the movie with the theme, an abstracted algorithm that describes the problem involved with the theme, a narrative of the theme, and finally, examples of the situation described by the theme.

In a data structure, you could simply see it as:
```
var book = [
 title,
 subtitle,
 chapter:  {
  title,
  domain,
  rationale,
  episodes : [
   {
    theme,
    quote,
    image,
    caption,
    rationale,
    abstract,
    algorithm,
    narrative,
    examples
   }
  ]
 } 
]
```

To close this prologue, I wanted to thank you for reading up to here, and I'm very looking forward to knowing you are reading it all, and please, engage me in any ways you want, to discuss it, change it, or just simply, exchange experiences without any commitments or strings attached. Worthwhile conversation points will be appended to the end of this book, let's see what we can make of it, up to you and me.
